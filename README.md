Simple local web-app using the Finch API.


Steps:
1. Install flask, requests, base64, and time to your python environment.
2. Input your Finch sandbox client ID and client secret in backend.py
3. From the terminal, run backend.py. This will spin up a URL on your local environment to interact with the front end.
